# Game Of Thrones music on Oric Atmos
This open source project created by Chlo√© Avrillon (aka LadyWasky/Waskol) for the [Oric Atmos 48K computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oric#Oric_Atmos), is an adaptation of The Game of Throne main's theme.

The player is written in C and 6502A assembly, using the [Oric Software Development Kit (OSDK)](http://osdk.defence-force.org/), a complete cross-development system allowing to create software for the Oric 1, Oric Atmos, and Oric Telestrat computers.
BASIC, C and a bit of assembly language were used for this project.

## Folders
The **Release** folder contains the digitalized tape you can use with an Oric emulator such like Oricutron
that you can find [here](http://www.petergordon.org.uk/oricutron/) and [here for the latest build](http://iss.sandacite.com/oricutron/)
In the **Sources/Documents** folder you will find the shanty used to produce the midi file that was then converted with some tools (Source/tools) into data directly understandable by the Yamaha AY-3-8912 soundchip.


## How to compile and build the tape file for Oric Kong :
Simply use the batch file **osdk_build.bat**, located in the **.\sources** (sources) directory the project.
After a couple of seconds, a new directory, **release**, will appear with a .dsk file in it. This can be used with an Oric emulator such like Euphoric (DOS) or Oricutron (Windows, Linux, MacOs,...).


## Thanks/Credits
I wish to thank some people of the Oric community namely DBug for its OSDK and Twilighte who is no longer among us who did so much for the Oric.
The player and irq routines are their work.
